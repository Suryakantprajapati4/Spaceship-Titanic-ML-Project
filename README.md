---

## 💡 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension during the **Spaceship Titanic** disaster.  
This is a binary classification problem (`Transported`: True or False).

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Information

- **train.csv** – contains the training data with labels
- **test.csv** – contains the test data without labels
- **sample_submission.csv** – sample format for submission

Important columns:
- `HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, `Cabin`, `Destination`, `Age`, `VIP`, `RoomService`, `FoodCourt`, `ShoppingMall`, `Spa`, `VRDeck`, `Name`, `Transported`

---

## 🧪 ML Models Used

- ✅ Logistic Regression  
- ✅ Decision Tree Classifier  
- ✅ Random Forest Classifier  
- ✅ XGBoost Classifier  
- ✅ LightGBM Classifier

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost & LightGBM  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

- Accuracy score on validation set
- Final predictions on `test.csv` submitted to Kaggle

---

## 🏁 Final Output

- Submission file: `submission.csv`
- Columns: `PassengerId`, `Transported`

---

## 📌 Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling  
2. Feature Engineering (like combining services spent, handling Cabin strings)  
3. Label Encoding / OneHotEncoding  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Comparison  
6. Kaggle Submission
